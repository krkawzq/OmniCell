# OmniCell: Jilin Universityâ€™s 2025 iGEM Project

OmniCell is Jilin University's official submission for the 2025 iGEM competition. Our goal is to develop a unified, LLM-driven framework to tackle multimodal challenges in synthetic biology. By integrating diverse biological data and leveraging the power of large language models, we aim to build a versatile system that advances both research and applications in the field.

## Survey

The Survey section contains our relevant research work. We conducted an in-depth investigation of multiple works and performed detailed method analyses to assist in building our own OmniCell model.

## Experiment

The Experiment section contains our experimental results. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our OmniCell model.

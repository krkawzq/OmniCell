# OmniCell: Jilin Universityâ€™s 2025 iGEM Project
OmniCell is Jilin University's official submission for the 2025 iGEM competition. Our goal is to develop a unified, LLM-driven framework to tackle multimodal challenges in synthetic biology. By integrating diverse biological data and leveraging the power of large language models, we aim to build a versatile system that advances both research and applications in the field.
